# system_transcription_error_detection_and_correction
This project was conducted as part of the Language Technology course (Prof. John Pavlopoulos). We were given text transcribed by humans and by an OCR system. The goal was to analyze the predictions given by the OCR system and the results of a Fasttext vectors model trained with the human transcripted text.
